## Use ADB without writing fullpath to executable
If ADB was installed on Windows with Android Studio then executable probably located at:
```bash
C://Users/{USER_NAME}/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools
```
By default to launch adb command user need to either move to directory with adb executable or write full path to it. To avoid it and be able to lunch adb by just typing «adb» in terminal, user can edit Operation System enviroment variable PATH. This variable is used by operation system to recognize commands and operable programs.

To edit this variable on Windows:
1. Press Windows button.
2. Type «Edit the system enviroment variables».
3. Press «Enviroment Variables...» button.
4. In «System variables» table look for «Path» Varialbe.
5. Select «Path» varialbe and click «Edit» button.
6. Add full path to the ADB directory.
7. Restart command line utility.

After this user can lunch adb commands without writing full path to adb executable.

Simmilar thing can be done on Mac and Linux operation systems.
## Connect to device over Wi-Fi
### Connect
```bash
adb connect 172.16.107.156:2111
```
IP adress and port of android device can be displayed on Android Notification Shade or in the Android Settings: 
1. Go to Developer Options
2. Turn on Wireless debugging
3. Look for IP address & Port

Note that PC and Android device should be connected to the same network.
### List connected devices
```bash
adb devices
```
### Disconnect
```bash
adb disconnect
```
### ADB unable to connect to device
Some devices, especially POS-terminals and Smart TVs may not connect in a first try. The fast way to fix it is to:
1. Turn off and turn on Android device Wi-Fi.
2. On Android devices try to browse web.
3. Restart adb:
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server 
```
4. Double check correctness of ip adress and the fact that PC and Android device are connected to the same network. Try to connect again:
```bash
adb connect 172.16.107.156:2111
```

## Install, Uninstall and Download apk
### Install
```bash
adb install -r full_path_to_file.apk
```
### List installed apps
```bash
adb shell pm list packages -f com.package
```
### Uninstall app
```bash
adb shell pm uninstall com.package.fullname
```
### Download apk from Android device
Get the full path name of the APK file for the desired package
```bash
adb shell pm path com.package.fullname
```
Use this full path with pull command
```bash
adb pull /data/app/com.example.fullname.apk
```
## Record video from screen
### Start recording
```bash
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/example.mp4
```
### Stop recording
```bash
Ctrl+C
```
### Download recording from device
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/example.mp4 .
```
### Remove recording from device
```bash
adb shell rm /sdcard/example.mp4
```
### Recording time limit is 3 minutes
Note that time limit for this utility is 3 minutes. You can make .bat file with content:
```bash
adb shell screenrecord --bit-rate 8000000 /sdcard/sr1.mp4
adb shell screenrecord --bit-rate 8000000 /sdcard/sr2.mp4
adb shell screenrecord --bit-rate 8000000 /sdcard/sr3.mp4
```
to subsequently capture screen recordings for further merging into longer videos.
## Screenshot capture
Take screenshot and download it on PC:
```bash
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screencap.png && adb pull /sdcard/screencap.png
```
Screenshot will apear in current directory of terminal session.
## Record LogCat
