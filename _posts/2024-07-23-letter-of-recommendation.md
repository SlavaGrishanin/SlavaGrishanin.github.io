Working at Financial Services Agency was the most intense three years of my life. The mobile department has grown before my eyes. I am grateful for the opportunity to make mobile application development one of the key areas of the company. I am also thankful to our users for their positive letters and reviews about our applications. It was customer feedback that mainly motivated me to create. Feature tracking was the most satisfying part of my job.

I am proud of the solutions we have provided that make people's lives better and easier every day. Thank you for your support and heartwarming farewell.

Each one of us has a journey, and every journey is a success. We all have the power to initiate change. I have left the company to move to the United States, and I am looking forward to new challenges and discoveries.
